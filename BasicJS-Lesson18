FCC says:
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

myVar = myVar - 5;

will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;

The initial code:
var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a = a - 6;
b = b - 15;
c = c - 1;

The task required me to convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

This was my code:
var a = 11;
var b = 9;
var c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
