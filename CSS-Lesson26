This lesson moves on from the previous and explains how you can style your 'body' element just like any other HTML element, 
and all your other elements will inherit your 'body' element's styles.

The initial code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
  }

</style>

The task required me to create a <h1> element with the text 'Hello World'
Give all the elements on the page the colour of green
Give the <body> element the font-family of 'monospace'

This was my code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
    font-family: monospace;
  }

</style>

<h1>Hello World</h1>

See how the code changes reflect in the test environment?
By adding the 'color:green;' and 'font-family:monospace;' within the <body> element
My <h1> heading element simply inherited what was declared so that I did not have to make 
any changes to the <h1> element directly.
