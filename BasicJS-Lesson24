FCC says:
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping characters:

    To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a carriage return.
    To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.

We learned this in the previous challenge.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed

The initial code:
var myStr; // Change this line

The task required me to assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

    FirstLine
        \SecondLine
    ThirdLine
    
This was my code (after a bit of head scratching):
var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"
