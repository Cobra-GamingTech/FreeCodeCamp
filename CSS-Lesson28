Moving on from our previous lesson, I am sure you saw how the <body> element CSS declaration 
had been overrode.

FCC says:
We just proved that our classes will override the 'body' element's CSS. So the next logical question is,
what can we do to override our 'pink-text' class?

The intial code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text">Hello World!</h1>

The task required me to create an additional CSS class called 'blue-text' that gives the element the colour blue.
Place this declaration under my 'pink-text' declaration
Apply the 'blue-text' to the <h1> element in addition to 'pink-text' to see who wins

This was my code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }

  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>

Remember how to apply multiple class attributes?:
class="class1 class2"

FCC NOTE:
It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.

However, the order of the 'class' declarations in the <style> section is what is important. 
The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. Because '.blue-text' is declared second, 
it overrides the attributes of '.pink-text'
