anchor elements were the topic around this lesson
<a> elements are used to link to content outside of your web page and need a destination web address called an
href attribute

The example by freeCodeCamp:
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org">this links to freecodecamp.org</a>

The task required me to create an <a> element which links to http://freecatphotoapp.com and have 'cat photos' as its anchor text

The intial code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>



  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">

  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
  hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy 
  fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

This was my code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>


  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">

  <a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink 
  fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

NOTE: see how I pointed to the destination address and gave it anchor text which says 'cat photos'
so on the page you will see 'cat photos' where if you click the text it will take you to the specific address
