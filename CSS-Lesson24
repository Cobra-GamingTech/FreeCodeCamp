This lesson will help you to understand Absolute versus Relative units.

FCC says:
The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. Absolute units tie to physical units of length.
For example, 'in' and 'mm' refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual
measurement on a screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution.

Relative units, such as 'em' or 'rem', are relative to another length value. For example, 'em' is based on the size of an
element's font.
If you use it to set the 'font-size' property itself, it's relative to the parent's 'font-size'.

The intial code:
<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 20px 40px 20px 40px;
  }

  .red-box {
    background-color: red;
    margin: 20px 40px 20px 40px;

  }

  .green-box {
    background-color: green;
    margin: 20px 40px 20px 40px;
  }
</style>
<h5 class="injected-text">margin</h5>

<div class="box yellow-box">
  <h5 class="box red-box">padding</h5>
  <h5 class="box green-box">padding</h5>
</div>

The task required me to add a 'padding' property to the element with class 'red-box' and set it to '1.5em'

This was my code:
.yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 20px 40px 20px 40px;
  }

  .red-box {
    background-color: red;
    margin: 20px 40px 20px 40px;
    padding: 1.5em;

  }

  .green-box {
    background-color: green;
    margin: 20px 40px 20px 40px;
  }

See the changes in code reflect in your testing environment.
Being able to manipulate every single aspect of your page to the very end is beneficial to creating the perfect vision.
Having the choice of different types of length changes allows for granularity as well.
