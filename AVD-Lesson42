hat's great, but it doesn't work right yet. Notice how the animation resets after 500ms has passed, 
causing the button to revert back to the original color. You want the button to stay highlighted.

This can be done by setting the animation-fill-mode property to forwards.
The animation-fill-mode specifies the style applied to an element when the animation has finished.
You can set it like so:

animation-fill-mode: forwards;

The initial code:
 button:hover {
    animation-name: background-color;
    animation-duration: 500ms;
    /* Only change code below this line */

    /* Only change code above this line */
  }

The task required me to set the animation-fill-mode property of button:hover to forwards so 
the button stays highlighted when a user hovers over it.

This was my code:
button:hover {
    animation-name: background-color;
    animation-duration: 500ms;
    /* Only change code below this line */
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    /* Only change code above this line */
  }
  
Now the button will stay highlighted while the user hovers over it.
