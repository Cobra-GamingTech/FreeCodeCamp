When you create a variable, it is available for you to use inside the selector in which you create it. 
It also is available in any of that selector's descendants. This happens because CSS variables are inherited,
just like ordinary properties.

To make use of inheritance, CSS variables are often defined in the :root element.

':root' is a pseudo-class selector that matches the root element of the document, usually the 'html' element. 
By creating your variables in ':root', they will be available globally and can be accessed from any other selector 
in the style sheet.

This is the initial code:
<style>
  :root {
    /* Only change code below this line */

    /* Only change code above this line */
  }

The task required me to define a variable named '--penguin-belly' in the ':root' selector and give it the 
value of 'pink'

This was my code:
<style>
  :root {
    /* Only change code below this line */
  --penguin-belly: pink;
    /* Only change code above this line */
  }

You can then see that the variable is inherited and that all the child elements which use it get pink backgrounds.
root is basically at the top of the chain hence why when we set the variable in our ':root', everything
else followed suit.
