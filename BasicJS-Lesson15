This lesson will simply show you how to divide one decimal number with another decimal number.

The initial code:
var quotient = 0.0 / 2.0; // Change this line

The task required me to change the 0.0 so that the quotient will equal to 2.2.

This was my code:
var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; // Change this line
