FCC says:
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.
Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:

// This is an in-line comment.

You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */:

/* This is a
multi-line comment */

So the code I used for this challenge:
// This would be an in-line comment with Javascript

/* This would be used for 
a multi-line comment*/

It's important to know how to comment in which language you use to inform other who may come across any of 
your programs
