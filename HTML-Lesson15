So for this lesson, it teaches you about creating bulleted unordered lists.

It is a pretty simple element to use.
An unordered list openeing tag is <ul> and its closing tag is </ul>
For every item you wish to place within the unordered list - you must input the item with <li></li> tags

The example that FCC provide:
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>

So you can see the <ul> being used to start an unoredered list while the <li> element is used to input each item in the list.

The intial code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
  hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy 
  fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>


The task required me to remove the last two <p> elements and create an unordered list of three things that cats love.

This is my code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <ul>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Tuna</li>
    <li>Bread</li>
   </ul> 
</main>

As you can see, I have demonstrated the use of the <ul> element and <li> elements to create an unordered list of three things.
NOTE: I have not come across a cat who loves bread haha so correct me if im wrong
