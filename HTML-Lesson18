This lesson is real simple.

The task required me to add placeholder text to the text field which was created previously.

The example FCC provide:
<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">

The intial code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>
  <input type="text">
</main>

I had to set the placeholder value of the text input to "cat photo URL"

This was my code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
</main>

See how my placeholder value goes in straight after my input type.
After running this code, within my field - the placeholder displays as "cat photo URL"
This is handy as you can signal to the user what input is required of them for this specific field.
Have a fiddle around with the placeholder text and personalise it to see what happens.
