The challenge - Create a shopping list in the variable myList. 
The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. 
The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

["Chocolate Bar", 15]

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

var myList = [["Orange", 2], ["Banana", 4], ["Grapes", 6], ["Apple", 8], ["Watermelon", 10]];
