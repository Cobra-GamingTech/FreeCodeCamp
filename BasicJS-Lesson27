FCC says:
Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:

var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
// ourStr is now "Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?"


This was the initial code:
// Only change code below this line
var myName;
var myStr;

The task required me to set myName to a string equal to my name
and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am well!"

This was my code:
// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Cobra.gamingtech";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
