This lesson had me confused a little due to not knowing what lorem ipsum was initally.

The lesson went into what the lorem ipsum text was and how it was used by web developers (as placeholder text)
which was the main teaching. I had to replace my old text within the <p> element and replace it with what FCC
called the 'kitty ipsum' text.

Kitty ipsum text = Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.

Initial code: 
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Hello Paragraph</p>

What I did was delete the old text within my paragraph element and replace it with the new text:
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

Doing these practical activities should help you a lot more in understanding the idea behind elements in use.
You can surely do this and move on to the next lesson but fiddle around with spacing and the input words to give you a more
personalised experience of each lesson.
I found it useful to do this as it helped me remember the concept a lot better.
