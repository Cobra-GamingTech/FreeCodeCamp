FCC says:
Colours have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. 
CSS3 introduced the 'hsl()' property as an alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.

Hue is what people generally think of as 'colour'. If you picture a spectrum of colours starting with red on the left, 
moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a colour fits along this line. 
In 'hsl()', hue uses a colour wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the colour on the circle is given 
as a value between 0 and 360.

Saturation is the amount of gray in a colour. A fully saturated colour has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated 
colour is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.

Lightness is the amount of white or black in a colour. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), 
where 50% is the normal colour.

Here are a few examples of using 'hsl()' with fully-saturated, normal lightness colours:

Color	  |  HSL
red	    |  hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
yellow	|  hsl(60, 100%, 50%)
green	  |  hsl(120, 100%, 50%)
cyan	  |  hsl(180, 100%, 50%)
blue	  |  hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
magenta	|  hsl(300, 100%, 50%)

The initial code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
  }

  .green {
    background-color: #000000;
  }

  .cyan {
    background-color: #000000;
  }

  .blue {
    background-color: #000000;
  }

  div {
    display: inline-block;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<div class="green"></div>
<div class="cyan"></div>
<div class="blue"></div>

The task required me to change the 'background-color' of each 'div' element based on the class names
(green, cyan, or blue) using hsl(). All three should have full saturation and normal lightness.

This was my code:
.green {
    background-color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%);
  }

  .cyan {
    background-color: hsl(180, 100%, 50%);
  }

  .blue {
    background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);
  }

You should see each property change after replacing the hex code with the hsl() for each colour
