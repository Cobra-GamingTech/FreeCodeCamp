FCC says:
Given that the skewX() function skews the selected element along the X-axis by a given degree, 
it is no surprise that the skewY() property skews an element along the Y (vertical) axis.

This is the initial code:
<style>
  div {
    width: 70%;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 50px auto;
  }
  #top {
    background-color: red;

  }
  #bottom {
    background-color: blue;
    transform: skewX(24deg);
  }
</style>

<div id="top"></div>
<div id="bottom"></div>

The task required me to skew the lement with the id of 'top' -10 degrees along the Y-axis by using the 
transform property

This was my code:
  #top {
    background-color: red;
    transform: skewY(-10deg);
  }
  
  You should now see the shape change reflect in the testing environment
