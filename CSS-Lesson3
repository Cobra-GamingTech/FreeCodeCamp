This lesson teaches you that classes are reusable styles which can be added to HTML elements.

The example provided by FCC:
<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

The example shows that a CSS class has been created which is called 'blue-text' within the <style> tag
Classes can be applied to a HTML element like this (Another example by FCC): 
<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Something that should be read and understood from the lesson is that in the CSS style element, class names start with a period. 
In  HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.
You can see this in both the examples provided above by FCC where the first example of the CSS 'style' element starts with a 
dot/full stop and the second example of the HTML style attribute where the class name does not have a dot/full stop

This was the initial code for the task:
<style>
  h2 {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <div>
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cat nip</li>
      <li>laser pointers</li>
      <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>

    </ol>
  </div>

  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

The task required me to change the 'h2' selector to '.red-text' inside the 
<style> element and update the colour value from 'blue' to 'red'

This was my code for making changes to the <style> element and <h2> element:
<style>
  .red-text{
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

I'll be honest - I was a little confused at tackling this task even though the instructions were clear.
I just started questioning the whole 'well if I've already set a rule then why do I need to assign something
within the actual <h2> element?
Turns out that I totally forgot that for the task, the 'h2' selector gets removed and replaced with '.red-text'
It is only one of many things that I will be confused about but yeah its a learning process.
You can fiddle wth the <style> element and <h2> element to reflect any other changes you might want to see.
Change it to the colour green or something
