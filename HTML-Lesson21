You know those forms that don't let you go anywhere without inputting certain data?
You might have come across this in contact forms for companies where you cannot submit the form without 
things like the name, email address and others being compulsory.

This lesson teaches you how you can require specific form fields so that a user will not be able to submit the form until 
it has been filled out as per your needs/requirements

FCC says:
For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your input element, 
like this: <input type="text" required>

So all you're doing is adding a 'required' attribute within your input element and it should work.

The intial code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>
  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

The task required me to make the text 'input' a 'required' field so that a user cannot submit the form without completing this
field.

This was my code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>
  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" required placeholder="cat photo URL">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

See how all I had to do was add the 'required' attribute?
After doing this, the effect should reflect within your testing environment where if you click the submit button,
it will not proceed and prompt you to fill out the field.
