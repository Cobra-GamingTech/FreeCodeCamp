With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry,
like this:

var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

The initial code:
// Only change code below this line
var myArray = [];

The task required me to modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order)

This was my code:
// Only change code below this line
var myArray = ["Grand Theft Auto", 5];
