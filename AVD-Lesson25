FCC says:
Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally. 
One way to do this is to set its 'margin' to a value of auto.

This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be
changed to block elements when you set the 'display' property to block.

The initial code:
<style>
  div {
    background-color: blue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;

  }
</style>
<div></div>

The task required me to centre the 'div' on the page by adding a 'margin' property with a value of auto

This was my code:
 div {
    background-color: blue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    margin: auto;
  }

Don't forget to practice all the properties you've learned so far as it'll take constant practice to remember
the small stuff.
