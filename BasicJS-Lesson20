FCC says:
The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

myVar = myVar / 5;

Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;

The initial code:
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;

The task required me to convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.

This was my code:
var a = 48;
var b = 108;
var c = 33;

// Only change code below this line
a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
