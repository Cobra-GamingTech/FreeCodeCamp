We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6

This was the initial code:
var difference = 45 - 0;

The task required me to change the 0 so that the difference is 12.

This was my code:
var difference = 45 - 33;

Remember that the challenge wants the answer as 12 not for you to change the actual number 0 to 12
