FreeCodeCamp aims to teach us how to build an HTML5 cat photo web app part-by-part

For this lesson, headings were explained a little more with <h> elements used to structure different types of headings.

As mentioned on the site: 
<h1> is used for main headings
<h2> used for subheadings
<h3> <h4> <h5> <h5> are elements used to indicate different levels of subheadings.

I had to add a <h2> tag that says 'CatPhotoApp' to create a subheading and should place it under my 'Hello World' heading
The initial code : <h1>Hello World</h1>

This is what I did:
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

Running the test allowed me to proceed as I met the criteria of creating the subheading
