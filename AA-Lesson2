FCC says:
In the last challenge, you learned that including an alt attribute when using img tags is mandatory.
However, sometimes images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only.
In these cases alt text may seem redundant or unnecessary.

In situations when an image is already explained with text content, or does not add meaning to a page, 
the img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:

<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">

Background images usually fall under the 'decorative' label as well. 
However, they are typically applied with CSS rules, and therefore not part of the markup screen readers process.

The initial code:
<h1>Deep Thoughts with Master Camper Cat</h1>
<article>
  <h2>Defeating your Foe: the Red Dot is Ours!</h2>
  <p>To Come...</p>
</article>

<img src="samuraiSwords.jpeg">

<article>
  <h2>Is Chuck Norris a Cat Person?</h2>
  <p>To Come...</p>
</article>

The task required me to add an alt attribute to the img tag and set it to an empty string.

This is my code:
<img src="samuraiSwords.jpeg" alt="">
