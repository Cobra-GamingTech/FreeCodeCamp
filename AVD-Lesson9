This lesson teaches you about using 'rgba' where the 'a' represents the level of opacity.

FCC says:
Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, 
you can add a background-color to the element holding the text you want to emphasize. 
This challenge uses rgba() instead of hex codes or normal rgb().

    rgba stands for:
      r = red
      g = green
      b = blue
      a = alpha/level of opacity

The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. 
The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear. 
rgba() is great to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity. 
This means you don't have to completely block out the background.

The initial code:
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;


  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Alphabet</h4>
      <hr>
      <p><em>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D. students</u> at
      <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page" target="_blank" class="links">Larry Page</a><br><br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin" target="_blank" class="links">Sergey Brin</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

This task requires me to adjust the 'background-color' of the <h4> element to make it a dark gray colour.
I also had to remove the 'height' property and add 'padding' of 10px(pixels) for the <h4> element

This is my code:
h4 {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);

  }

NOTE: 0.1 is the opacity value
