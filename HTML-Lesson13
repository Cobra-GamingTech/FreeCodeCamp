This is an interesting lesson because it teaches you how to make dead links
It might seem like 'oh why would I need this if I can simply remove the link'
It's gonna come in handy at a later point throughout the curriculum when learning JavaScript(JS)

The intial code: 
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">

  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot,
  hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy
  fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

The task requires me to make my 'a' element a dead link by setting my href attribute to a hash symbol #

My code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">

  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
  hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy
  fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

It's simple - just replace the whole href attribute with a # as shown above and this will create a dead link
Keep in mind, this will be used later through the JS content.
