FCC says:
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

[["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]

This is also called a multi-dimensional array.


The initial code:
// Only change code below this line
var myArray = [];

The task required me to create a nested array called myArray.

This was my code:
// Only change code below this line
var myArray = [["Grand Theft Auto", 5], ["Red Dead Redemption", 2]];
