If I am not mistaken, this is the last lesson in Basic HTML and is a really important lesson
it teaches you about adding another level of organisation to your HTML document within the <html> tags 
with the <head> and <body> elements. 

So the way it works is that any markup information about the page would go into the <head> tag while any markup information 
with the content of the page would go into the <body> tag. 

There is also something called Metadata elements such as <link> <meta> <title> and <style> which would go inside the <head> 
element

This is the example that FCC provides to explain these elemts with how they are laid out:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- metadata elements -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page contents -->
  </body>
</html>

The task required for me to complete was to edit the markup on the code so that there is a <head> and <body>.
The <head> element should only include the <title> and the <body> should include the <h1> and <p> elements.

The intial code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <title>The best page ever</title>

  <h1>The best page ever</h1>
  <p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box
  until treats are fed. Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway. I like big cats and i can not 
  lie kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot,
  hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. Meow i could pee on this if i had the energy for slap owner's face at 5am 
  until human fills food dish yet scamper. Knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish scratch the furniture. 
  Make meme, make cute face. Sleep in the bathroom sink chase laser but pee in the shoe. Paw at your fat belly licks your 
  face and eat grass, throw it back up kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your 
  ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

</html>

This was my code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  <title>The best page ever</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>The best page ever</h1>
  <p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in
  litter box until treats are fed. Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway. I like big 
  cats and i can not lie kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles 
  chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. Meow i could pee on this if i had the energy for slap 
  owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish yet scamper. Knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own 
  dish scratch the furniture. Make meme, make cute face. Sleep in the bathroom sink chase laser but pee in the shoe.
  Paw at your fat belly licks your face and eat grass, throw it back up kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed 
  everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
</body>
</html>

When creating your website, like all other types of programming - its about structure.
Utilising all these elements allow for an effective and responsive website.

AND THATS IT!! well for HTML at least. Take everything you have learnt in each lesson and just practice making basic websites.
It will help in learning what is next to come - CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and tells the browser how to display the text and other content which is written in HTML.
