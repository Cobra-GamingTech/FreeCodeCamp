This lesson teaches you how to change the colour of some text.
The task required me to change the <h2> element style so that the text colour would become red.

This is the example provided by FCC, where the code turns the text colour to blue:
<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>

The advice that FCC also gives is that it is a good practice to end inline 'style' declarations with a ; (semi-colon)
See this in the example FCC provide.

I won't input the all the code on the screen but only that which allows the text colour to change to red as the rest is not 
being worked on at the moment and it will take up unneccessary space within the file
This was my code:
<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>

NOTE: I'm still learning as I go but I have noticed that the 'color' style property only operates under US English spelling
I'm from London[UK] where we spell it as 'colour' and that did not work when stated within the code.
The colour should be reflected within the test environment where the <h2> element (heading) is the colour red.
But yeah, pretty simple stuff and handy when you need to change text colour's for any reason.
