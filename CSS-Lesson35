This lesson explains using the RGB values to colour elements

FCC says:
The RGB value for black looks like this:

rgb(0, 0, 0)

The RGB value for white looks like this:

rgb(255, 255, 255)

Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with RGB you specify the 
brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.
If you do the math, the two digits for one color equal 16 times 16, which gives us 256 total values.
So RGB, which starts counting from zero, has the exact same number of possible values as hex code.

The example provided by FCC:
how you'd change the body background to orange using its RGB code.

body {
  background-color: rgb(255, 165, 0);
}

The initial code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: #F00;
  }
</style>

The task required me to replace the hex code in the 'body' element's background colour with the RGB value for black

This was my code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
  }
</style>

As you proceed through the lessons, don't forget to practice.
CSS is all about the small stuff which allows for a more detailed creation.
You don't want to forget things like creating your rules or the different ways of 
setting colours for elements.
