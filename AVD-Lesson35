FCC says:
The transform property has a variety of functions that let you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. 
When used with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state of an element, 
the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements.

Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them:

p:hover {
  transform: scale(2.1);
}

The initial code:
<style>
  div {
    width: 70%;
    height: 100px;
    margin:  50px auto;
    background: linear-gradient(
      53deg,
      #ccfffc,
      #ffcccf
    );
  }



</style>

<div></div>

The task required me Add a CSS rule for the hover state of the div and use the transform property to 
scale the div element to 1.1 times its original size when a user hovers over it.

This was my code:
div {
    width: 70%;
    height: 100px;
    margin:  50px auto;
    background: linear-gradient(
      53deg,
      #ccfffc,
      #ffcccf
    );
  }
  div:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
  }
  
  Remember that the task wants you to ADD a rule not include the transform into the existing rule set as it is a completely
  different effect.
