This lesson teaches you how to override class declarations with Inline styles.

The example provided by FCC to help you remember:
<h1 style="color: green;">

The initial code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  #orange-text {
    color: orange;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 id="orange-text" class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>

The task required me to use an inline style to make the <h1> element the colour white.

This was my code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  #orange-text {
    color: orange;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 style="color: white;" id="orange-text" class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>

It is really simple, just use the inline style and leave everything else the way it was
and you should see that the <h1> element turns into the colour white overriding previous 
declarations.

Having the ability to override, once again, allows for granularity as you can make a declaration for one type of element
to be set in a specific way however through the creation there might be just one title using the same element that
requires a different colour or something to look more appealling or suitable for the content.
It's the small things that have the biggest effect.
