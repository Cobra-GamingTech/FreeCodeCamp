HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags which include:
<main> <header> <footer> <nav> <video> <article> <selection> and so many more.

Not only do these tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML code but it allows you to be as granular as you want with
your design. There is still a lot more content to help you understand this through each lesson but don't worry, I'll get there.

This lesson goes into how the <main> tag help search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.
The example freeCodeCamp provides:
<main> 
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
</main>
showing how two child elements are nested within the <main> tag.

The task required me to create a second paragraph element after the existing <p> element and then nest those within a <main> tag.

The intial code: 
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

This was my code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

Hoping you can see that after the h2 element, I inserted a <main> tag and nested two paragraph elements within.

a few words of advice: DON'T FORGET CLOSING TAGS
