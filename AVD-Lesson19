FCC says:
CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model.
Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items 
sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the
normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to
its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right,
and top or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned.

The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:
p {
  position: relative;
  bottom: 10px;
}

This is the initial code:
<style>
  h2 {


  }
</style>
<body>
  <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
</body>

The task required me to change the 'position' of the 'h2' to 'relative', and use a CSS offset to move it 15px(pixels) 
away from the 'top' of where it sits in the normal flow.

This was my code:
h2 {
      position: relative;
      top: 15px;

  }
  
You should see the changes in position within the testing environment.
