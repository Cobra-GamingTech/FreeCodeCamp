FCC says:
You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

"Alan Peter".length; // 10

For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles",
we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using the firstName.length property.

The initial code:
// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line

lastNameLength = lastName;

The task required me to use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to 
lastNameLength.

This was my code:
// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
