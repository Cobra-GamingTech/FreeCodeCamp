Recall from the last lesson where we had the option of using GENERIC_NAME as a fallback font?
This is what this lesson covers as it teaches you to specify how your fonts should
degrade should the first choice not be available to the user.

This is the example that FCC provide showing how you can have the broswer degrade to the 'sans-serif' 
font should the 'Helvetica' font not be available:
p {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

This is the intial code:
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <div>
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cat nip</li>
      <li>laser pointers</li>
      <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>flea treatment</li>
      <li>thunder</li>
      <li>other cats</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

The task required me to comment out the link at the top which allowed for the importing of the 'Lobster' font.
I also had to set the fall back font set to be 'monospace'

This was my code:
<!--<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> -->
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

See how after 'Lobster', I put the 'monospace' font as a way of telling the browser what to degrade to in the instance 
Lobster is not available
NOTE: If you have the 'Lobster' font installed on your machine then the font of the <h2> elementshould not change
due to your broswer being able to find the font.
It's actually really cool as you can call it a small contingency for times where you want your branding to be
consistent with what you might have in place initially.
