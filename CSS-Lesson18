This lesson teaches you how to add a negative margin to an element

Basically, if you set the 'margin' of an element to a negative value, then the element will grow larger.

The intial code:
<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .red-box {
    background-color: crimson;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: -15px;
  }

  .blue-box {
    background-color: blue;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 20px;
  }
</style>

<div class="box yellow-box">
  <h5 class="box red-box">padding</h5>
  <h5 class="box blue-box">padding</h5>
</div>

The task required me to change the 'margin' to a negative value of -15px of the blue box

This was my code:
.yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .red-box {
    background-color: crimson;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: -15px;
  }

  .blue-box {
    background-color: blue;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: -15px;
  }

You can view the effects of the change in code on your testing environment.
The thing about CSS properties right, is that it is all just small stuff.
But if you put all the things you've learned together then it becomes this big bowl of endless creativity.

I used to hate intro stuff like HTML and CSS because it felt like I couldn't do anything with it.
It ended up letting me take my first steps into coding and opened my eyes to something new.
Trust me when I say, get through the Responsive Web Design and make some engaging projects.
Use it all as a portfolio of your practical knowledge and get where you wanna be.
