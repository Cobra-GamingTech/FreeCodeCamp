This lesson teaches you how to create a custom CSS variable.

FCC says:
To create a CSS variable, you just need to give it a name with two hyphens in front of it and assign it a value like this:

--penguin-skin: gray;

This will create a variable named --penguin-skin and assign it the value of gray.

The initial code:
<style>
  .penguin {
    /* Only change code below this line */

    /* Only change code above this line */

The task required me to create a variabke name '--penguin-skin' and give it a value of 'gray'

This was my code:
.penguin {
    /* Only change code below this line */
    --penguin-skin: gray;
    /* Only change code above this line */

Remember, you can change it to any other value for experimental purposes.
Being able to create your own custom CSS variables add a degree of flexibility when in the process
of building your own creation.
