FCC says:
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. 
You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'

Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
// ourStr is "I come first.  I come second."

The initial code:
var myStr; // Only change this line

The task required me to build myStr from the strings "This is the start. " and "This is the end." using the + operator.

This was my code:
var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."; // Only change this line
