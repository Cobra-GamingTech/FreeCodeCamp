This lesson teaches you how to use 'media query' to change a variable.

FCC says:
CSS Variables can simplify the way you use media queries.

For instance, when your screen is smaller or larger than your media query break point, 
you can change the value of a variable, and it will apply its style wherever it is used.

The initial code:
<style>
  :root {
    --penguin-size: 300px;
    --penguin-skin: gray;
    --penguin-belly: white;
    --penguin-beak: orange;
  }

  @media (max-width: 350px) {
    :root {
      /* Only change code below this line */

      /* Only change code above this line */
    }
  }

This was required of me in the task:
In the ':root' selector of the media query, change it so '--penguin-size' is redefined and given a value of 200px(pixels). 
Redefine '--penguin-skin' and give it a value of 'black'.
Then resize the preview to see this change in action.

This was my code:
<style>
  :root {
    --penguin-size: 300px;
    --penguin-skin: gray;
    --penguin-belly: white;
    --penguin-beak: orange;
  }

  @media (max-width: 350px) {
    :root {
      /* Only change code below this line */
    --penguin-size: 200px;
    --penguin-skin: black;
      /* Only change code above this line */
    }
  }
  
Making this change to the code reassigns both variables in the :root to the values I have no redefined.
Please, please, please practice these changes regularly as it can be pretty difficult to maintain if you don't work on it
This is just the freeCodeCamp stuff but maybe try create your own variables and then use a media query to redefine your values.
Thats the end of the Basic CSS stuff, now its time to move on to bigger and better stuff.
