This lesson is really important to understand as sometimes you will actually have HTML elements
which will receive multiple style that with one another.

FCC says:
Your h1 element can't be both green and pink at the same time.

The intial code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
</style>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>

This task required me to see what happens after creating a CSS class called 'pink-text'
Then to give the <h1> element the class of 'pink-text'

This was my code:
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }

  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text" Hello World!</h1>

See how it effects your <h1> element.
Clearly, 'pink-text' overrode the 'body' element declaration.
