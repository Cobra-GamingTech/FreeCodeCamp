FCC says:
We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. 
This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
// ourStr is now "I come first. I come second."

The initial code:
// Only change code below this line

var myStr;

The task required me to build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings:
"This is the first sentence. " and "This is the second sentence." using the += operator. 

This was my code:
// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
