FCC says:
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

i--;

is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;

The initial code:
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar - 1;

The task required me to change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.

This was my code:
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar --;

In using this change, it eliminates the need for an assignment of something (equal sign)
