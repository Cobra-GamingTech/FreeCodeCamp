Nearly forgot to tell you probably the most important thing ever!
You have to DECLARE the doctype of a HMTL document
What your essentially doing is telling the machine what it is that you are writing

For this task, I was required to add a DOCTYPE tag for HTML5 making my declaration
and underneath add opening <html> and closing </html> tags which wrap around a <h1> heading element

This is to declare the Doctype: <!DOCTYPE html>

My code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1> This is me declaring </h1>
 </html> 
 
 REMEMBER, the declaration goes on the very first line or beginning of your document before proceeding to code.
 Don't forget the opening and closing <html> tags
