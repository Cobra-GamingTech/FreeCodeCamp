The lesson proceeds to teach you how to create a basic web form

It begins by going into <input> elements and how they are a convenient way of requesting input from a user.

The example provided by FCC:
<input type="text">

See that the example for the input element is self closing and does not require a standard closing tag like other elements
(e.g.</>)
The task required me to create an input element of the type 'text' below the lists.

The intial code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>


</main>

This is my code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>
<input type="text">

</main>

See that I created an input element which will take text type input from the user. This type of input can obviously be
redirected to wherevver you wish but this is just the concept behind creating a text field. It should reflect in your testing
environment on freeCodeCamp as a text box underneath your lists.

It's a simple task and pretty useful feature to learn.
