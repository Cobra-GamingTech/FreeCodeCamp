We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169

The initial code:
var product = 8 * 0;

The task required me to change the 0 so that the product will equal 80

This was my code:
var product = 8 * 10;
