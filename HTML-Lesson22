RADIO buttons!!!

You have probably come across this in a multiple choice test or survey of some sort.
You can use radio buttons for questions where you want a user to give you an answer out of several options.

So what happens with creating a radio button?
An example of a radio button by FCC:
<label> 
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>

Radio buttons are a type of 'input'
See when we created the text field, our 'input' type was text?
This time around it is 'radio'
A radio button can be nested within its own <label> element.
All related radio butttons should have the same 'name' attribute to create a group of radio buttons.

In the lesson, FCC also says:
It is considered best practice to set a 'for' attribute on the <label> element, with a value that matches the value of the 
'id' attribute of the <input> element. This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label 
and the child input element. 
For example:
<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>

The intial code of this lesson:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>
  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

I was required to add a pair of radio buttons to the form with each being nested in its own <label> element.
One button should be for 'indoor' while the other option should be for 'outdoor'
Both options should share the 'name' attribute of 'indoor-outdoor' for the purpose of creating a radio group.

This was my code for this lesson:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>
  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     <label> 
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>
<label> 
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor
</label>
  </form>
  
  See how I just created two <label> elements for the two radio buttons which were required?
  Also set the radio group for both buttons as 'indoor-outdoor'
  I personally, get confused when a lot of stuff gets thrown at me in an instant but I need a minute or two to
  breakdown all the information in front of me.
  The answer is always there, its about taking the time to identify what you need to solve the problem.
  This is just a lesson for teaching purposes, imagine once you get the hang of creating websites? Jheeze.
  
  NOTE: I think I stated the word 'radio' about 12 or 13 times and thats excluding the use of the word within the code samples
