This one is simple

To remove any elements, as I am sure anybody knows - just remove them.

Initial code: 
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot,
hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

I was required to delete the h1 element to simplify the view:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
