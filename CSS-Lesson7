This lesson teaches you how to import a google font.
Even though there are a number of styles available to choose, you have the option of getting a hold of 
non-standard, custom web fonts for any website.
You can grab any custom from any website provided that you reference it. (Correct me if I'm wrong)

Google Fonts is a free library of web fonts which can be used in CSS by referencing the font's URL.
NOTE: FCC page says to skip this task if Google is blocked in your country so keep it in mind)

This is the code required to obtain the font 'Lobster' which we will be using for the task:
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

For this to work, you have to begin by inserting it at the top of the editor which is above the <style> element.
The task requires me to apply this 'Lobster' font to the <h2> element.

When creating this in the CSS style block, it has to be written in this syntax:
font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;

This is the intial code:
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <div>
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cat nip</li>
      <li>laser pointers</li>
      <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>flea treatment</li>
      <li>thunder</li>
      <li>other cats</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

This is my code with the additions:
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

See how I inserted the required link for the font at the top?
This then allowed me to import the font later when I required it.
Some might be asking what is the GENERIC_NAME and why is it not included in your code?
GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available. 
I left it out on purpose to make sure that my code worked correctly allowing me to proceed.
Don't forget, you have to use a 'h2' selector for it to be implemented (see the additions above)
