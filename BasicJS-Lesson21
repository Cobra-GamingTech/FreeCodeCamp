Previously we have used the code

var myName = "your name";

"your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more 
characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

The task required me to create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the 
values of your first and last name, respectively. 

This was my code:
var myFirstName = "cobra";
var myLastName = "gamingtech";
