FCC says:
The next function of the transform property is skewX(), which skews the selected element along 
its X (horizontal) axis by a given degree.

The following code skews the paragraph element by -32 degrees along the X-axis.

p {
  transform: skewX(-32deg);
}

The initial code:
<style>
  div {
    width: 70%;
    height: 100px;
    margin:  50px auto;
  }
  #top {
    background-color: red;
  }
  #bottom {
    background-color: blue;

  }
</style>

<div id="top"></div>
<div id="bottom"></div>

The task required me to skew the element with the id of 'bottom' by 24 degrees along the X-axis using the 'transform'
property.

This was my code:
#bottom {
    background-color: blue;
    transform: skewX(24deg);
  }
  
Remember that id rules have a # infront whereas a element rule would have a .(period)
You should see the shape change reflect in the test environment
