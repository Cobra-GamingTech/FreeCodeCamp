FCC says:
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope. 
That means, they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  var loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}
myTest(); // logs "foo"
console.log(loc); // loc is not defined

loc is not defined outside of the function.

The initial code:
function myLocalScope() {
  'use strict';

  // Only change code below this line

  console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);

The task required me to declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.

This was my code:
function myLocalScope() {
  'use strict';

  // Only change code below this line
var myVar;
  console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);

Don't overthink this one like I did for a minute - it is literally the creation of a local variable is all
