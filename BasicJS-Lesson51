FCC says:
We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

Example

function plusThree(num) {
  return num + 3;
}
var answer = plusThree(5); // 8

plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

The task requires me to create a function timesFive that accepts one argument and multiplies it by 5
returning a new value. 

This was my code:
function timesFive(num) {
  return num * 5;
}
var answer = timesFive(5);

By replacing the number within the parentheses, you will be able to test the function
