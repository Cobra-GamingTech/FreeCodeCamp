In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].

Example:

var firstName = "Charles";
var lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1]; // lastLetter is "s"

The initial code:
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line

The task required me to use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.

This was my code:
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1]; // Change this line
