FCC says:
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;

is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;

The initial code:
var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;

The task required me to use the ++ operator on myVar.

This was my code:
var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar ++;

This may seem like a basic task but for me it wasn't - it took me a little longer than usual
to understand what was being asked of me. 
Thats the learning I guess
