So here we are - Applied Visual Design.

This lesson goes into creating visual balance using the text-align property.

FCC says:
Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the 'text-align' property.

text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.
text-align: center; centers the text
text-align: right; right-aligns the text
text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text.

The initial code:
<style>
  h4 {

  }
  p {

  }
  .links {
    margin-right: 20px;

  }
  .fullCard {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page" target="_blank" class="links">Larry Page</a>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin" target="_blank" class="links">Sergey Brin</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

The task required me to align the text of <h4> which says "Google" to the centre.
Justify the paragraph which is about how Google was founded.

This was my code:
 h4 {
text-align: center;
  }
  p {
text-align: justify;
  }

After inputting the code, the changes should reflect in your test environment.
It's a simple and clean way of aligning each and every element that you wish.
