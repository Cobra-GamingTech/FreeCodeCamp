This lesson teaches you how to change the font size of an element.
This is a very useful thing to know as it is not just the basics but I have come across a number
of website/blog builders where changing the font sometimes does not work using the editing features that they have.

You are better off directly going into the page HTML code and making the changes there before implementing
I just find it a lot more satisfying.

The example provided by FCC:
h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}

See that the'font-size' CSS property is used to control the font size.
For the task, I was required to set the <p> elements font size to 16 pixels.

This was the intial code:
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <div>
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cat nip</li>
      <li>laser pointers</li>
      <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>flea treatment</li>
      <li>thunder</li>
      <li>other cats</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

This was my addition to the <style> tag:
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  p {
  font-size: 16px;
}

</style>

If you can recall, from a previous lesson - this is a basically like a rule you've set to your <p> elements.
I'm still repeating the concept to better understand it but yeah make some changes to get a better feel of the 
code which is written in front of you
