You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1]; // secondLetterOfFirstName is "d"

The initial code:
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line

The task required me to set thirdLetterOfLastName to ewual the third letter of the lastName variable
using bracket notation.

This was my code:
// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2]; // Change this line
