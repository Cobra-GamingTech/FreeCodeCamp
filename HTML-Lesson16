This lesson teaches you the same thing as Lesson 15 however the only difference is that we will be working with an 
orderd list

In the last lesson we used <ul> to create an unordered list and <li> elements for listing each item.
For this lesson we will use <ol> to create an ordered list which will be numbered and of course, the <li> elements to list 
each item.

The example by FCC:
<ol>
  <li>Garfield</li>
  <li>Sylvester</li>
</ol>

The initial code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>

</main>

This task is simple as I have to have an ordered list for "Top 3 things cats hate:" and unordered list for things that cats
love.
<ul> and </ul> for unordered list
with <ol> and </ol> for ordered list
Same concept of creating a list, just different tags to specify what type.

My code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>mice</li>
    <li>dogs</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
   </ol> 

</main>

It's easy stuff as the syntax is real simple
