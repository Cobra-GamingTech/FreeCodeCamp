This lesson was introducing the <p> element which is used to paragraph text on a website.

The lesson required me to create a paragraph element beneath my subheading.

The intial code: 
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

I then moved to do this:
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>

Running the tests allowed me to proceed.

The best thing about freeCodeCamp is that the simple layout and instructions along with the test environment
allows you to learn effectively while identifying any errors quickly. Obviously I am still early in the HTML
content but there will be more stuff to come.
