Commenting is very important not just within HTML but all programming languages.
It allows for other developers to understand the reason behind why you wrote specific code a certain way
or to simply inform someone the function behind the code.

In HTML, comments start with <!-- and end with a -->
It might seem a little confusing but you do it enough and it will become a force of habit

The intial code within the lesson:
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, h
airball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
-->

The task required me to uncomment all the current code (h1, h2 and p elements)
To do this, I removed the comment elements like this:
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

Doing this led to the code turning back to its usual font colour and allowing me to proceed to the next lesson
