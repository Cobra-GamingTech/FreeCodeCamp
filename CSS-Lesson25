This lesson discusses CSS inheritance.

FCC says:
Every HTML page has a <body> element.
We can prove that the <body> element exists here by giving it a 'background-color' of black.

The initial code:
<style>

</style>

The task required me to give the <body> element a background colour of black while properly formatting
the CSS rule with the curly brackets.
DO NOT forget the semi-colon ; at the end.

This was my code:
<style>
body {
  background-color: black;
}

</style>

Always remember, your CSS rules are created within your style block
as you have done in all the previous lessons.
The change in code will reflect to your testing environment.
Try give it a different colour and input some other elements like<h2> or <p> 
and see how they look with your chosen background colour
