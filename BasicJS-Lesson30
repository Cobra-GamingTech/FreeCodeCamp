Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. 
They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". 
So if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

Example:

var firstName = "Charles";
var firstLetter = firstName[0]; // firstLetter is "C"

The initial code:
// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line

The task required me to use the bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to
firstLetterOfLastName.

This was my code:
// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // Change this line
