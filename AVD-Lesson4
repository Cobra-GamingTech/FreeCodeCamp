This lesson, we'll be using the 'strong' tag to make chosen text bold.

FCC says:
To make text bold, you can use the 'strong' tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important.
With the 'strong' tag, the browser applies the CSS of 'font-weight: bold;' to the element.

This was the initial code:
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page" target="_blank" class="links">Larry Page</a><br><br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin" target="_blank" class="links">Sergey Brin</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

The task required me to wrap a 'strong' tag around "Stanford University" inside the 'p' tag.

This was my code:
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;

  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at 
      <strong>Stanford University</strong></p>
      
I'll be honest - I misunderstood how to complete this task at first.
I was too busy trying to make it work by inserting the CSS property of 'font-weight: bold;' to
the rule set for 'p'. Wrapping the <strong> tag means literally what I demonstrate above. 
NOTE: make sure there are no spaces in between the words and the tags as I initally did this:
<strong> Stanford University </strong></p>
and it didn't work.
Make sure it's hugging the chosen text.
