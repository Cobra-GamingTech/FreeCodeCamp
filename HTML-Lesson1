For the first lesson, opening and closing tags are explained.

<h1> is the opening tag for the heading
</h1> is the closing tag for the heading (The difference I'm sure which is pretty obvious is the slash before h1)
There will be more about headings further in the HTML content as far as I am aware.

The intial code = <h1>Hello</h1>

To complete this, I simply input the word 'World' after 'Hello' like this:
<h1>Hello World</>

Clicking the 'Run the tests' button allowed me to proceed.
