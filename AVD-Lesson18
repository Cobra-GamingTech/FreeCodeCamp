FCC says:
A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.
For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the ':hover' pseudo-class selector. 
Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

a:hover {
  color: red;
}

This is the initial code:
<style>
  a {
    color: #000;
  }

</style>
<a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com/" target="_blank">CatPhotoApp</a>


The task required me to style all 'a' tags black and to add a rule so that when the
user hovers over the 'a' tag, the colour is blue.

This was my code:
<style>
  a {
    color: #000;
  }
a:hover {
  color: blue;
}

It's handy to use this feature so that you can specify to a user if this specific text redirects you somewhere 
or is important to what they are reading. Pretty much for any reason of your choice.
