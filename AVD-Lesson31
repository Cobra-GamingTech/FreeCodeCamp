Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions,
otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient() function. 
Here is the general syntax:

background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...);

The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, 
where 90deg makes a vertical gradient and 45deg is angled like a backslash. 
The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient.

Example:

background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));

The initial code:
<style>
  div {
    border-radius: 20px;
    width: 70%;
    height: 400px;
    margin: 50px auto;

  }

</style>

<div></div>

The task required me to Use a 'linear-gradient()' for the 'div' element's 'background', 
and set it from a direction of 35 degrees to change the color from #CCFFFF to #FFCCCC

This was my code:
div {
    border-radius: 20px;
    width: 70%;
    height: 400px;
    margin: 50px auto;
    background: linear-gradient(35deg, #CCFFFF, #FFCCCC);
  }
  
See the changes reflect in your test environment.
Fiddle with the hex and add other colours to see other types of transition.
