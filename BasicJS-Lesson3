In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.

myVariable = 5;

This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value
is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

myVar = 5;
myNum = myVar;

This assigns 5 to myVar and then resolves myVar to 5 again and assigns it to myNum.

This was the initial code:
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line

The task required me to assign the value 7 to variable a
and assign the contents of a to variable b

This was my code:
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
var a = 7;
var b = a;
