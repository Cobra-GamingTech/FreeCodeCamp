The lesson had pretty much the same task as Lesson 5 however it required me to comment out
only the h1 and p elements and not my h2

The intial code: 
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
-->

This is my code:
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
-->
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!--
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
-->

As I am sure you can see, I used the comment tags for the h1 element and p element which left the h2 element to be the only
text which could be viewed. 
You can fiddle with the comment tags to write your own comment so you can understand how it works better.
