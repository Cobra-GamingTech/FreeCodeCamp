I thought <a> elements were just for external links, but it turns out they can also be used to create internal links
so that you can jump to different sections of a webpage.

To create an internal link, the link's href attribute must be assigned a hash symbol # plus the value of the 'id' attribute 
for the element that you want to link to internally. You need to add the same id attribute to the element being linked to.

This is the example that FCC provides:
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a> 
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>

See how there is a hash symbol for the 'contacts-header'
and also an id value which is for 'contacts-header'
Basically, when a user clicks on the 'Contacts' link, they will be taken to the section of the page with the 'Contacts' header 
element.

First things first - do not be thrown off by all the text in the lesson as it happened to me.
Direct your attention to the instructions to complete the task as this will help you identify exactly what and where you need 
to insert any changes to proceed to the next lesson.

The intial code: 
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>

  <a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>

  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">

  yet destroy couch.</p>

</main>

<footer>Copyright Cat Photo App</footer>

The task required me to:
change the external link to an internal link by changing the href attribute to #footer
change the text 'cat photos' to 'jump to bottom'
remove the - target="_blank" attribute
add an id attribute with the value of footer to the <footer> element at the bottom of the page

Simply work through this, one at a time.

This was my code:

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>

  <a href="#footer" >Jump to Bottom</a>

  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">

  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot,

<footer id="footer"> Copyright Cat Photo App</footer>

NOTE: I ran the tests initially with the end of the page as - <footer> id="footer"> Copyright Cat Photo App</footer>
I just could not put my finger on it but went back to the example and followed the code as if I wrote it
I came to identify that the opening <footer> tag should not have the > arrow which allowed the code to work and allow me 
to proceed

As you progress through, you might come across small things like this which might not allow your code to pass the 
requirements first time, so just keep an eye on how the example is shown and understand how it is done. Fiddle with the 
internal links to give the page a more personalised touch for your learning experience.
