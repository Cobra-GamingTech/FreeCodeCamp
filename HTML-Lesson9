This lesson is really important as it teaches you about adding images to a website.
You will be able to see major differences between adding images by copy and pasting into the site and 
using an actual image element.

Adding images is done by using the <img> element and pointing to the image's source URL is done by including the 
src attribute

The example FCC provided to explain the idea was:
<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">

All <img> elements must have an alt attribute as explained within the lesson as the text inside the alt attribute is used
for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed in the instance that the image fails to load.
The lesson also notes that 'if the image is purely decorative, using an empty alt attribute is a best practice'

The intial code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>


  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
  hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy 
  fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

The task required me to add an <img> element within the <main> element but before the existing <p> elements
It also states that the src attribute should point to - https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat

This was my code: 
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>

<img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A relaxing cat">
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
  hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy
  fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

NOTE: see how my <img> element is written and includes the source pointing to the URL required and applicable text within
the alt attribute. Don't forget that to close this element - it is a closing arrow >
I became confused as a normal closing tag </img> worked but I simply followed by the example that FCC provided.
