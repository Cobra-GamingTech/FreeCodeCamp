This lesson explains how there are a wide range of CSS properties that you can change to make an element within
look a specific/certain tpye of way

See the previous lesson where we changed the text colour of the <h2> element to red. 
This is just one of so many things that allow a website to be made unique to yourself and others.
The lesson goes into creating a <style> block and create something called a 'CSS Selector' which make coding something for a
specific element more efficient.

This is the example FCC provide if you wanted ALL your <h2> elements to have the text colour as red:
<style>
  h2 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

See above the code written which defines a rule for the <h2> element.
It is important to have both opening and closing curly braces {} around each rule for it to be implemented.
Don't forget opening and closing TAGS for <style>
Be sure to remember the semi-colon to the end of each rule which you create.

The intial code:
<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <div>
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cat nip</li>
      <li>laser pointers</li>
      <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>flea treatment</li>
      <li>thunder</li>
      <li>other cats</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

The task required me to delete the current <h2> element 'style' attribute and create a 'CSS style block' which in turn
would turn all <h2> elements to the colour blue.

This was my code: 
<style>
  h2 {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>

  <div>
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cat nip</li>
      <li>laser pointers</li>
      <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>flea treatment</li>
      <li>thunder</li>
      <li>other cats</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

See how I added my style block to the top of my document and in turn the change was reflected in the testing environment.
If you want to verify this change works on all <h2> elements then just add another set of <h2> tags with any text you like and 
you should see the text become blue.
It is a lot more efficient creating a rule for something like a group of headings to stay consistent instead of going through
each <h2> element and adding the 'style' attribute.
