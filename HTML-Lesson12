The aim of this lesson is to teach you about nesting links within other text elements.

The example provided by FCC:
<p>
  Here's a <a target="_blank" href="http://freecodecamp.org"> link to freecodecamp.org</a> for you to follow.
</p>

This was so confusing for me at first but again - its about taking it one step at a time

Normal text is wrapped in the p element: <p> Here's a ... for you to follow. </p> 
The anchor element <a> (which requires a closing tag </a>):<a> ... </a> target is an anchor tag attribute that specifies 
where to open the link and the value "_blank" specifies to open the link in a new tab 
href is an anchor tag attribute that contains the URL address of the link:
<a href="http://freecodecamp.org"> ... </a> 
The text, "link to freecodecamp.org", within the a element called anchor text,
will display a link to click:
<a href=" ... ">link to freecodecamp.org</a> 

And in turn the result will look like this:
Here's a link to freecodecamp.org for you to follow.

The intial code: 
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>

  <a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>

  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">

  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball
  run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur 
  catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

The task required me to nest the existing 'a' element 
within a new 'p' element 
just after the existing 'main' element
The new 'p' element should have text that says "View more cat photos", where "cat photos" is a link
while the rest of the text is plaintext

What I thought was difficult, was actually pretty easy:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
<p>View more
  <a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com" >cat photos</a>
</p>
  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">

  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
  hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy 
  fur catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

See how after the h2 element, I inserted the new <p> element while nesting the existing <a> element within the paragraph.
Adding the text: "View more" in the <p> element gave me the final result of output being:
View more cat photos 
(where cat photos was a link)

It's actually really cool stuff.
