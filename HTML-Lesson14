This lesson teaches you that you can make elements into links by nesting them within
an 'a' element

The example provided by FCC:
<a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera."></a>

See how the 'img' element is nested within an 'a' element?
Doing the same thing for this task

The intial code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">

  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball 
  run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur
  catnip scratched.</p>
</main>


My code:
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
  cat photos</a>.</p>


  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run 
  catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur 
  catnip scratched.</p>
</main>

If you hover over the image, it should allow you to click on it as it has turned into a link.
Its actually useful and the practice can be seen in hundreds of active websites.
