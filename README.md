# FreeCodeCamp
FreeCodeCamp curriculum

My main aim is to pretty much become a veteran game dev and using Github and other tools is a part of the learning process.
I'm hoping to upload my work through FCC not only to reinforce my knowledge but to also provide an insight into my way of thinking provided there is a different thinking process. The FCC curriculum has all the instruction through each task and thousands of hours of study which will help build an important foundation for whichever route you might be interested in.

Once I get a bit better at what I want to do, I hope to start different open-source game projects and immerse myself in the industry to learn the tricks of the trade. Gaming is a dynamic environment but it isn't just building games but an environment to unleash the creative process.
Hoping that by using Git & Github, it will allow me to become more fluent with the process of dealing with things like branches, pull requests and other collaborative features.

If there are any other noobs like myself out there then please, by all means, use my repo to learn if you want.
If I do end up doing something wrong, just lemme know - I can take any criticism.
Mistakes are made to become better.

Coding is the FUTURE!
