FCC says:
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;

Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.

The task required me to define variable a with var and initialise it to a value of 9.

This was my code:
var a = 9;

I find this odd for myself personally as being a python fanatic there is a 'more or less' similar way of setting a variable
however it is good to practice and get into the habit.
