We can store decimal numbers in variables too. 
Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

The initial code:
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line

The task required me to create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part(e.g. 5.7).

This was my code:
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
var myDecimal = 5.8;
