This lesson teaches you about the 'value' attribute and how it is used when a form gets submitted.
It's really important to set values which are related to what you require and are easily understood as the inputs of the type
'radio' or 'checkbox' report their values from the 'value' attribute.

The example provided by FCC:
<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>
<label for="outdoor"> 
  <input id="outdoor" value="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor 
</label>

When the form is submitted with for example, the indoor checkbox selected - the form data will give you the output of
indoor-outdoor=indoor.
'indoor-outdoor' being your group and 'indoor' being the selection by the user which you created initially.

In the lesson, FCC also says:
If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. In this scenario, if the user 
clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful. 
So the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.

This is actually something I find to be very important as I am sure the who point of you allowing data to be collected and sent 
back to your destination is to collect the data and acquire results. Having the default attribute set will not give you the 
result you want or need.

Put it like this: 
you can ask someone face to face for their name, address, DOB and all that other stuff and do the droning job of 
putting it into spreadsheet software like Excel, manually, one by one
OR
have them fill out your form and the data sent back to you is already assigned to your chosen attributes making the job
and life itself easier.

The intial code:

    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

The task required me to give each of the radio and checkbox buttons a 'value' attribute.

See how simple it is? just add the 'value' attribute with an assigned value so that the data on the server end is easier for
you to sort and identify.
NOTE: I was actaully confused when I say <br> but this is just to create a line break and aids in structuring your content.
This should reflect in your test environment where your radio buttons are on one line and checkboxes are on another.
It looks so much better than all of it being stuck together on one line.
